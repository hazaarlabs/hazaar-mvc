# Creating a New Application

If you have installed HazaarMVC correctly by following installation instructions then creating an application should be a snap.

Now, all you need to do is run composer to create a new application in the current directory. So make sure you are in your workspace and run:

```shell
# composer create-project hazaarlabs/example
```

Once that is executed you will have a working sample project that you can use to start building your project. The HazaarMVC config tool creates the framework directory structure, sets up a default project layout and links the library directory back to the library source.

You will end up with a directory named example which contains the application, library, and public directories of your project and some example code to help get you started quickly.
