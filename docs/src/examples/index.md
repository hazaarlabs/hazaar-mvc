## What practical examples do you want to see?

Hazaar has been in development since 2012 and has been used in a number of projects, but our documentation is still a work in progress.  We are working on a number of examples to help you get started with Hazaar and will
be adding them to this page as they are completed.

If you have a specific example you would like to see, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://git.hazaar.io/hazaar/framework/issues) on our GitLab repository.
