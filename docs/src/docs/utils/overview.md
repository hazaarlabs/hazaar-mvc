# Utilities

These are useful utility classes and functions that provide features missing from PHP or offer convenient shorthand for common tasks. They are now organized under the [`Hazaar\Util` namespace](/api/class/Hazaar/Util.html). For example, array-related utilities are found in [`Hazaar\Util\Arr`](/api/class/Hazaar/Util/Arr.html).

Hazaar's utility classes are designed to make common programming tasks easier and more expressive. They provide a consistent, object-oriented interface for working with arrays, strings, numbers, dates, objects, and more. If you previously used global helper functions, you will now find their improved and expanded versions in the `Hazaar\Util` namespace. Explore the API documentation for each class to discover all available methods and features.
