# Documentation

Welcome to the Hazaar Framework documentation.  This documentation is a work in progress and is being updated regularly.  If you have any questions or need help, please feel free to [contact us](/contact).

For now, the best place to start is the [Getting Started](/docs/start/install/overview.md) guide.  This will walk you through the process of installing the Hazaar Framework and creating your first application.
