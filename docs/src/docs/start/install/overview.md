# Introduction

This page explains how to install the Hazaar Framework and get a new skeleton application project running as quickly as possible.

Depending on your chosen installation method, you may or may not need PHP 8.0+ installed on your system:
- **Composer or Manual install:** PHP 8.0 or higher must be available on your system.
- **Docker/DevContainer:** All dependencies, including PHP, are provided in the container—no need to install PHP locally.

## Choosing an Installation Method

Hazaar supports several installation methods to suit different workflows and environments:

1. [Composer](/docs/start/install/composer.md) – The recommended and fastest way to get started. Composer will create a new project directory with all required dependencies and example code. (Requires PHP 8.0+ on your system)
2. [Manual](/docs/start/install/manual.md) – For advanced users who want more control, you can clone the example application directly from Git and set up dependencies yourself. (Requires PHP 8.0+ on your system)
3. [Docker](/docs/start/install/docker.md) – Run Hazaar in a containerized environment for a consistent setup across machines or for production deployment. (No need to install PHP locally)

**Tip:** Most users should start with Composer. Docker is ideal for teams or anyone wanting a reproducible environment. Manual installation is best if you want to customize every aspect of your setup.

## Next Steps

- Choose your preferred installation method above and follow the linked guide.
- After installation, see the [Configuration](/docs/basics/configuration.md) and [Quick Start](/docs/start/quickstart.md) guides to configure and run your new Hazaar application.
- For troubleshooting or more information, check the [FAQ](/docs/faq/) or [contact us](/contact).

Once installed, you'll have a working skeleton app ready for development.
