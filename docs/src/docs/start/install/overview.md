Getting started with Hazaar is easy.  This guide will walk you through the steps to get your first Hazaar application
up and running.

The first decision you need to make is how you want to install Hazaar.  There are two options available to you:

1. [Composer](/docs/start/install/composer) - The easiest way to get started with Hazaar is to use Composer.  This will create a new project directory with all the required dependencies.
2. [Manual](/docs/start/install/manual) - If you prefer to have more control over the installation process, you can clone the example application directly from Git.
