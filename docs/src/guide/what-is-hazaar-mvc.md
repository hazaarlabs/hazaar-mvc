# What is Hazaar MVC?

## Introduction

Hazaar MVC is a lightweight Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework written in PHP.  It was started in 2012 by Jamie Carl. It aims to provide a simple and efficient way to develop web applications using the [MVC architectural pattern](/guide/what-is-mvc). The framework focuses on simplicity, performance, and ease of use.

Hazaar MVC follows the traditional MVC principles, where the Model represents the data and business logic, the View handles the presentation and user interface, and the Controller manages the communication between the Model and the View.  To get a better understanding of MVC, see: [What is MVC?](/guide/what-is-mvc).

* Support for RESTful APIs
* Built-in WebSockets server
* Support for Authentication and Authorisation

Hazaar MVC is designed to be simple and easy to use.  It is not designed to be a full featured framework like Laravel or Symfony.  It is designed to be a simple and lightweight framework that can be used to build simple web applications quickly and easily.
