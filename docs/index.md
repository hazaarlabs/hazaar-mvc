# Online Documentation

## Welcome to the Hazaar MVC online documentation.

For information on licencing please read the licence page.

Please be aware that this documentation is a work in progress. I am but one man and I work on it when I can so it is hardly complete.  I have tried to focus more on the most advanced features of Hazaar MVC at this point as the basics should be quite obvious from the example application included.

If you have any specific questions or would like to request some documentation be created, please contact me.

## Getting Started

The best place to get started here is the [Getting Started](getting_started/requirements.md) section.
