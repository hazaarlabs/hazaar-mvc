# Key/Value Storage

Warlock can also operate as a simple key/value storage system, also known as an in-memory database, similar to applications such as [Redis](http://www.redis.io) and [Memcached](http://memcached.org).

Warlock provides methods for storing and retrieving data by both the PHP server side as well as in the JavaScript client, allowing an alternative method for transferring data between the server and the browser, or to allow data generated in the browser to be quickly and easily stored for later use.
