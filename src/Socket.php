/**
 * The PHP socket extensions class.
 *
 * The socket class implements a low-level interface to the socket communication functions based on the popular BSD sockets, providing
 * the possibility to act as a socket server as well as a client.
 *
 * When using this class, it is important to remember that while many of them have identical names to their C counterparts, they often
 * have different declarations. Please be sure to read the descriptions to avoid confusion.
 *
 * Those unfamiliar with socket programming can find a lot of useful material in the appropriate Unix man pages, and there is a great deal
 * of tutorial information on socket programming in C on the web, much of which can be applied, with slight modifications, to socket
 * programming in PHP. The Â» Unix Socket FAQ might be a good start.

    /**
     * Socket object constructor.
     *
     * @param mixed $domain The domain parameter specifies the protocol family to be used by the socket.
     *
     *        Available address/protocol families:
     *        - *AF_INET*	IPv4 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols of this protocol family.
     *        - *AF_INET6*	IPv6 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols of this protocol family.
     *        - *AF_UNIX*	Local communication protocol family. High efficiency and low overhead make it a great form of IPC (Interprocess
     *        Communication).
     * @param int $type The type parameter selects the type of communication to be used by the socket.
     *
     *        Available socket types:
     *        - *SOCK_STREAM* Provides sequenced, reliable, full-duplex, connection-based byte streams. An out-of-band data transmission
     *        mechanism may be supported. The TCP protocol is based on this socket type.
     *        - *SOCK_DGRAM* Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed maximum length). The UDP protocol is based
     *        on this socket type.
     *        - *SOCK_SEQPACKET* Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data transmission path for datagrams of fixed
     *        maximum length; a consumer is required to read an entire packet with each read call.
     *        - *SOCK_RAW* Provides raw network protocol access. This special type of socket can be used to manually construct any type of
     *        protocol. A common use for this socket type is to perform ICMP requests (like ping).
     *        - *SOCK_RDM* Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee ordering. This is most likely not implemented on your
     *        operating system.
     * @param int $protocol The protocol parameter sets the specific protocol within the specified domain to be used when communicating
     *                      on the returned socket. The proper value can be retrieved by name by using getprotobyname(). If the desired protocol is
     *                      TCP, or UDP the corresponding constants SOL_TCP, and SOL_UDP can also be used.
     *
     *        Common protocols:
     *        - *icmp* The Internet Control Message Protocol is used primarily by gateways and hosts to report errors in datagram
     *        communication. The "ping" command (present in most modern operating systems) is an example application of ICMP.
     *        - *udp* The User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless, unreliable, protocol with fixed record lengths. Due to these aspects,
     *        UDP requires a minimum amount of protocol overhead.
     *        - *tcp* The Transmission Control Protocol is a reliable, connection based, stream oriented, full duplex protocol. TCP
     *        guarantees that all data packets will be received in the order in which they were sent. If any packet is somehow lost during
     *        communication, TCP will automatically retransmit the packet until the destination host acknowledges that packet. For
     *        reliability and performance reasons, the TCP implementation itself decides the appropriate octet boundaries of the
     *        underlying datagram communication layer. Therefore, TCP applications must allow for the possibility of partial record
     *        transmission.
