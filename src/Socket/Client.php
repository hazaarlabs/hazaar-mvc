/**
 * The socket client class
 *
 * The socket client class is used to establish connections via TCP or send data via UDP sockets to another host. It can be implemented as
 * a stand-alone class object and used to send or receive data by polling. It can also be extended and use event handler methods that are
 * triggered when a connection is established, data is received, etc. It's also possible to register event callback methods on the stand-alone
 * object to allow for maximum flexibility in how the class can be used.
 *
 * h3. Example #1 - Standalone Object:
 *
 * This example creates the client as a standalone object.  It requests a connection and then once connected we send some data to the
 * remote server.  After that we wait for $pollInterval milliseconds (default 1000) for data to arrive before dumping it to the output
 * buffer and closing the connection.
 *
 * <pre><code class="php">
 * //Create the socket client object
 * $client = new \Hazaar\Socket\Client();
 *
 * //Connect to the remote host
 * $client->connect('www.google.com.au', 80) or die('Connection failed!');
 *
 * //Send some data
 * $client->send("GET /\n");
 *
 * //Waits for $pollInterval milliseconds for data to arrive
 * if ($client->wait()) {
 *
 *      var_dump($client->recv());
 * }
 *
 * //Close the connection
 * $client->close();
 *
 * exit();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * h3. Example #2 - Standalone object using callbacks (simple):
 *
 * This example does the same thing as example #1 but using callback methods.
 *
 * <pre><code class="php">
 * //Create the socket client object
 * $client = new \Hazaar\Socket\Client();
 *
 * //Register a connect callback.  This call back will send some data when it's triggered.
 * $client->on('connect', function($client){
 *      $client->send("GET /\n");
 * });
 *
 * //Register a receive data callback.  This call back will dump out the received data and then close the connection.
 * $client->on('recv', function($client, $data){
 *      var_dump($data);
 *      $client->close();
 * });
 *
 * //Connect to the remote host
 * $client->connect('www.google.com.au', 80) or die('Connection failed!');
 *
 * //Run the socket client for 5 seconds.
 * $client->run(5);
 *
 * exit();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * h3. Example #3 - Standalone object using callbacks (advanced):
 *
 * This example does the same thing as example #2 except instead of just running the client for 5 seconds until data arrives, we register
 * a poll event handler to implement our own timeout code.
 *
 * <pre><code class="php">
 * //Create the socket client object
 * $client = new \Hazaar\Socket\Client();
 *
 * //Register a connect callback.  This call back will send some data when it's triggered.
 * $client->on('connect', function($client){
 *      $client->set('start', time());
 *      $client->send("GET /\n");
 * });
 *
 * //Register a receive data callback.  This call back will dump out the received data
 * //and then close the connection.
 * $client->on('recv', function($client, $data){
 *      var_dump($data);
 *      $client->close();
 * });
 *
 * //Register a poll callback.  This is triggered each time the main run() loop cycles.
 * //Here we wait 5 seconds before returning false to tell the main loop to exit.
 * $client->on('poll', function($client){
 *      if((time() - $client->get('start')) >= 5 )
 *          return false;
 * });
 *
 * //Connect to the remote host
 * $client->connect('www.google.com.au', 80) or die('Connection failed!');
 *
 * //Run the socket client indefinitely.
 * $client->run();
 *
 * exit();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * h3. Example #4 - Class extension:
 *
 * This example creates the client as a sub-class of \Hazaar\Socket\Client.  This allows you to override the default event handlers
 * and execute your code within the context of the sub-class.
 *
 * <pre><code class="php">
 * class MyGoogleClient extends \Hazaar\Socket\Client {
 *
 *      private $start;
 *      private $timeout = 5;
 *
 *      public function __construct() {
 *          parent::__construct();
 *          $this->connect('www.google.com.au', 80) or die('Connection failed!');
 *          $this->run();
 *      }
 *
 *      protected function onConnect() {
 *          echo "Connected to Google!\n";
 *          $this->set('start', time());
 *          $this->send("GET /\n");
 *      }
 *
 *      protected function onRecv($data) {
 *          var_dump($data);
 *          $this->close();
 *      }
 *
 *      protected function onPoll() {
 *          if ((time() - $this->start) >= $this->timeout)
 *              return false;
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * $client = new MyGoogleClient();
 *
 * exit;
 * </code></pre>
